        <h2>3. Service Terms</h2>
        <h3>Quotes and Market Information</h3>
        <p>Information provided through Pennieshares (including links to external websites) is from independent providers. This information is for general guidance only and does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell. Pennieshares and its providers do not guarantee the accuracy, timeliness, or completeness of this information. Your reliance on such information is at your own risk. We are not liable for any damages arising from the use of this information.</p>

        <h3>Transaction Limits</h3>
        <p>We may impose limits on the amount or frequency of transactions you conduct. These limits may be increased if your identity is authenticated and may change at our discretion.</p>

        <h3>Fees</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify fees for our services in the future. We will notify you and provide a grace period before any fee changes are implemented.</p>

        <h3>Payment Investigation & Account Freezing</h3>
        <p>Pennieshares may review high-risk transactions. Payments may be held, cleared, or cancelled. We reserve the right to freeze or block accounts if we suspect illegitimate funds or if you cannot provide the original source of funds during an investigation.</p>

        <h3>Order Cancellation/Modification</h3>

        <h3>Transaction Reviews</h3>
        <p>We review account and transaction activity for suspicious or illegal activity and compliance with this Agreement. Reviews may lead to delayed/blocked transfers, funds being held, account suspension/termination, or seizure of funds by court order. You may be required to provide additional information for verification.</p>
